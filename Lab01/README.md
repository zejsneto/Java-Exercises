## Exercise 1
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the size of the side of a square and then displays an empty square of that size with asterisks 
on the edges. Your program must work with squares of all possible side lengths between 1 and 20.

## Exercise 2

<br>b) amount sold.
<br><br>Your program must use a switch statement to determine the selling price of
