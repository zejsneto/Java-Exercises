# Java Exercises - Extra 1
⚠️These exercises are the continuation of the [Lab 01 exercises](https://github.com/zejsneto/Java-Exercises/tree/main/Lab01).

## Exercise 5
Fliper is a type of game where a metal ball falls through a maze of paths until it reaches the bottom of the maze. 
The amount of points the player earns depends on the path the ball follows. The player can control the ball's path by changing the position of some of the maze doors. 
Each door can be in position 0, which means facing left, or in position 1, which means facing right. Consider the flipper in the figure below, which has two doors. 
Door P is at position 1 and door R is at position 0. This way, the ball will fall through path B.<br>

<br>You must write a program that, given the positions of the P and R ports, in this figure, tells you which of the three paths, A, B or C, the ball will fall!


## Exercise 6
(Pythagorean Triples) A ​​right triangle can have sides that are all
integers. A set of three integer values ​​for the sides of a triangle
rectangle is called a Pythagorean triple. These three sides must satisfy
the relationship that the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to the
square of the hypotenuse. Find all Pythagorean triples for side1,
side2 and hypotenuse, all no greater than 500. Use a triple for loop
nested that try all possibilities. This is an example of
brute force computing.
